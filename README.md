My name is **Isabel Roig Penso** and I am a UCLA graduate with a major in Statistics and a minor in Digital Humanities. I have knowledge of statistical analysis, predictive modeling, machine learning, neural networks and data mining. Using programming languages such as C++, R, SQL, Python, MATLAB, and tools such as Tableau and Power BI, I develop analytical projects that bring me better insight into different industries and business needs. For the last year, I have worked as a Data Analyst at The Oncology Insitute of Hope and Innovation and before that, I worked in a machine learning research lab and was promoted to manage 5 direct reports as well as lead multiple teams from Harvard University, Michigan University and Florida State University. 

I am very passionate to keep working on different analytical projects that might help bring insight into different industries and fields. Please reach out to me for opportunities for collaboration and keep expanding our horizons when it comes to Data!
